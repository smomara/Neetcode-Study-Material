# Two Pointers

Two pointers is an algorithmic technique that involves maintaining two pointers that traverse an array.

There are various variations of the two pointers technique but the most common one is the left and right pointers. In this approach, two pointers start at opposite ends of an array and move toward each other.

By manipulating the positions of the pointers based on certain conditions or criteria, a wide range of problems that require traversing arrays can be solved efficiently.

Since each pointer only visits an element a maximum of one time, the time complexity of this technique is O(n).
